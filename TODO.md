# Investment Tracker — TODO

## Add Holding Modal

- [ ] **Ticker search / autocomplete** — instead of typing ticker symbols manually, integrate a search so the user can type a company name or partial ticker and get suggestions. Could use Yahoo Finance's search API (`https://query2.finance.yahoo.com/v1/finance/search?q=...`) to resolve ticker, company name, and Yahoo ticker automatically, removing the need to fill those fields by hand.

## Detail Page

- [ ] **Historic returns** — when navigating to a closed (zero-share) position's detail page, show a summary of realised P&L, holding period, and annualised return for the closed position.

## General

- [ ] **Price alerts** — optional push/email notification when a holding moves beyond a threshold.
